# ProjectV_Goober_UI_and_UX
Goober – UI/UX Development
Goober is a ride-hailing application inspired by Uber, designed to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for both riders and drivers. This repository documents the UI/UX contributions of the design team, covering wireframes, design assets, components, and workflows that shaped the product’s front-end experience.

Overview
The UI/UX team’s responsibility in Goober was to ensure a consistent, user-friendly, and scalable interface across platforms. This included:

Designing wireframes and prototypes for rider and driver flows.

Creating a visual identity (colors, typography, iconography).

Building reusable components for React Native implementation.

Conducting peer reviews and gathering user feedback for iterative updates.

Features Designed
Rider Experience
Clean onboarding & login screens with quick authentication.

Ride request flow: pickup/drop-off selection with map integration.

Real-time ride tracking: clear status indicators, driver information, and ETA.

Payment flow: minimal UI steps, clear confirmation screens, support for multiple payment methods.

Driver Experience
Straightforward driver onboarding and approval process.

Ride acceptance/decline UI optimized for quick decisions.

Trip and earnings dashboard with simple visual summaries.

Shared Components
Universal navigation system (bottom tabs, top headers).

Buttons, cards, and modals designed for accessibility and reuse.

Light/dark theme considerations for user preferences.

Tools & Stack
Design & Prototyping: Figma

Development Framework: React Native with Tailwind NativeWind

Collaboration: Discord (async design discussions & critiques)

Version Control: GitHub for design specifications, component handoffs, and changelogs

UX Process
Research & Competitive Analysis
Reviewed existing ride-hailing apps to benchmark best practices and identify UX pain points.

Wireframing
Low-fidelity sketches were produced to iterate quickly on flows before committing to high fidelity.

Prototyping
Interactive prototypes in Figma for testing with internal stakeholders before handoff.

Feedback & Iteration
Weekly syncs with the dev team to clarify feasibility and adjust flows.

Implementation Handoff
Exported design tokens, assets, and style guides into a shared repository for seamless dev integration.

UI Guidelines
Typography: Clean sans-serif font with scalable hierarchy.

Color Palette: Contrasting, high-visibility colors for accessibility and brand identity.

Components: Built for reusability in React Native. Each component documented with interaction guidelines.

Accessibility: WCAG-compliant contrast ratios, large touch areas, and clear navigation patterns.
